I apologize for completing the assignment in React instead of Vue.js. As I am currently more familiar with React, I aimed to deliver a functional project within the timeframe.
However, I am eager to learn Vue.js and will quickly adapt if given the opportunity. Thank you for your understanding and consideration.
And i had kept a very simple UI not so many design just simple logic.
